// that differ, so a screen that does not change costs no bytes and a moving ball costs
// a few. That is only right while the terminal still shows what was sent, so anything
// that could have changed the screen behind its back must call invalidate: the next
// frame is then sent in full, after erasing the display.
//
// A frame that changes anything is sent as one synchronized update, in one write. In
// full mode every frame is sent whole and nothing else is written, which is what a
// program reading the output of a headless Run expects.
